/*
RPNSlowTuringMachine returns the result of a string in reverse polish notation (postfix) using a Turing machine.
The original band in the words exploded in a slice and results are hold on the band but in num form.
The band has two copies one in string and one in float. This is mandatory to avoid costly conversions.

A processed operation or value is erased by replacing it with ? which is a reserved sign.
A calculated value is marked as num which is also a reserved word.

An invalid sign is interpreted as a value and the next operation panics.

Shorter code that the fast version as it is using a "while" format but slower than the Go for structure.
